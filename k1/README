***** IMPORTANT *****
=====================

The setupTFTP.sh script does not provide any protection, i.e., students can
potentially overwrite each other's binaries!  Please only run the script
after you have verified that no other user uses that particular RPi.

Also, please do not tinker with the 'public' directories in /u/cs/452/public
directly.  This might leave the TFTP load process unusable, which might be a
problem outside regular business hours.


Build and Run (linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca)
=============

cp -a /u/cs452/public/iotest <dest>
cd <dest>
make
/u/cs452/public/tools/setupTFTP.sh <barcode> kernel8.img
# reboot RPi


Output on Control PC (as realfolk user)
====================

logRPi.sh <barcode>

Knowledge
1. you need to store registers before calling a certain function, under assemb, especially if you are calling a c funtion, otherwise param go bye bye
2. why is HCR_RW have RW bit set to 1? what does it do

What is done:
1. Makefile receive every .c -> .cc
2. based on https://wiki.osdev.org/C%2B%2B, new flag is added -> -nostdlib -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions
3. there are issue with static variable that is not directly assigned to a constant, thus, some of the variable under rpi.c such as spi,aux is changed from a variable to an lazily loaded pointer to the memory. Now, memory would be correctg
4. extern "C"  is used on memset, etc under rpi.cc, it is mandatory for program to compile yet the c++ require some of the c functionality to ever perform basic operation such as creating a string "hello world", in which, we need to provide a proper funcrtion so linker doesn't break. However, C++ doesn't follow C's naming convention, thus for the underlying linkder to identify memset, we need to use  extern "C" to convert it back to the C compiler format. -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1041866/what-is-the-effect-of-extern-c-in-c
5. restrict is replaced by __restrict__

What need to be done
1. (DONE) https://piazza.com/class/lar7zlqtolr5xe/post/31 
2. (DONE) https://piazza.com/class/lar7zlqtolr5xe/post/33 
3. k1 test process needed to update the actual key to the return value of create task to see if the value is correct
4. we need to have a flag based enable debug. This means during make, we can setup flag like "make -DEBUG" that will generate executable with debug enabled, this means we can have weird debug line in our code while production build doesn't get influenced. refer -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14251038/debug-macros-in-c. This is incredibly handy in the future and ideally should be available for k1. 
5. We need an offical space to store documentation and design docs, I will get them setup\
6. proper slab allocation is needed for kernel.cc, ideally a slab size of 100, need to be tested at least manually
