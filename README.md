## Group Members

## K1 Build Instructions

To build the main executable:

* Use git to download the code from our repository:

    ```git
    git clone ist-git@git.uwaterloo.ca:t28cai/cs452-microkernel.git
    ```

* `cd` into the k1 directory:

    ```sh
    cd cs452-microkernel/k1
    ```

* Run `make` to build the code into a loadable, executable image.

A report summarizing and outlining our work can be found in cs452-microkernel/k1/K1_report.pdf.
